## Basic Qualifications
* You must be male.
* You must be a legal adult.
* You must believe in some form of God.
* You must have a clean criminal record.

If you don't meet the qualifications of being male or of believing in God, "regular" (mainstream) Freemasonry is not for you. If you're still interested, though, [email me and we'll talk about alternatives](mailto:texanmason@gmail.com).

## How to Get Started
You need to find a lodge near your home or work, and start visiting them.

To find lodges in Texas, use either of these links:
* [Google Map of lodges in Texas](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oNJpkBZHwj_jBMjAJDx7wI1uJfTgMtGl&usp=sharing)
* [A searchable list of lodges in Texas](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftx.grandview.systems%2Fpublic_lodges%2Fsearch&sa=D)

To find lodges outside of Texas, find the Grand Lodge website for your state or country, and contact them.
* Use [this link](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ugle.org.uk%2Fabout%2Fforeign-grand-lodges&sa=D) to find your Grand Lodge.

When you're visiting a lodge, reach out to them by phone, email, or Facebook first. Let them know you want to visit and that you want to be a Freemason. Find out what their dress code is, and come dressed appropriately. Once you start visiting, make sure to talk to everyone, and ask lots of questions. It may take a few weeks, or even months, but we want to get to know you, and make sure you're a good fit for us, and we're a good fit for you.

Once you are given a petition (application) to join, ask the members of the lodge to sign it for you. Once that is done and your application has been filed, you will be interviewed at home. If you pass the interview, you will be nominated for election to membership. If you are elected, you'll be informed by the lodge secretary, and the process can begin.
