					<p>Fort Worth Lodge takes a careful approach towards letting prospective candidates join. Generally speaking, we encourage candidates to meet with us regularly for five to eight months. This allows the members of the lodge to get to know you, and you to get to know the members of the lodge.</p>
					<p>When you contact the lodge, we will invite you to our monthly "New Candidate Night" session, where we'll establish in-person contact for the first time (if we don't already know you). At New Candidate Night, we'll field your questions about Freemasonry and Fort Worth Lodge, and ask you some questions of our own.</p>
					<p>After attending New Candidate Night, we'll invite you to attend our monthly stated business meeting, where we all share fellowship over a meal prior to the meeting. Non-masons may not attend the meeting, but all are welcome at the dinner table. We also meet every Monday, and aspiring candidates often meet with us before we open lodge on each of those evenings.</p>
					<p>Once the lodge feels comfortable with you, and you feel comfortable with the lodge, we will walk you through the process of petitioning the lodge. You can find a petition for the degrees of Freemasonry <a href="assets/pdf/petition.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. You will need two members of Fort Worth Lodge to recommend you for membership. You will also need to list three Freemasons as character references.</p>
					<p>Please let us get a chance to know you before you petition our lodge. <strong>If we do not know you well enough, we will not sign or take your petition.</strong> This isn't personal.</p>
					<p>When the lodge receives your petition, we will read it out loud in lodge so that all the members of the lodge can know who is petitioning for membership. After reading your petition, we will assign an investigative committee to visit with you.</p>

						<h4>Investigation & Balloting</h4>
					</div>
					<p>The investigation process is simple, but important. Before the lodge can formally vote to accept your petition, we must send three members of the lodge to visit you and interview you. Generally speaking, these three interviews will take place at your home. Meeting at your home helps encourage a more relaxed attitude for all parties involved in the interview, and allows us to meet your family.</p>
					<p>We strongly encourage you to invite your investigation team members to your home at a time when your family will be home. One of the most important things in the process of becoming (and being!) a Freemason is to have the support of your spouse. Making sure that your spouse is present allows them to get involved in the process in a healthy way, and, more importantly, allows us to answer any questions your spouse may have for us about Freemasonry.</p>
					<p>Once your investigation committee has met with you, they will report the results of their interviews with you at the next month's stated business meeting. Once the lodge hears the report, the committee is dissolved, and a secret ballot (anonymous vote) will take place, which will determine whether your petition has been accepted or rejected. The lodge secretary will inform you of the results.</p>
