Dear Companion [Lastname]:

I would like to conduct my official visit with you and the companions at [Name] Council No. [Number] on [Date] at [Name] Masonic Lodge. 

In order that I may complete the required paperwork, I need to visit with you, the Recorder, the Treasurer, the Right Illustrious Deputy Master, and the Illustrious Principal Conductor of the Work, prior to the meeting. You are welcome to invite other officers in addition to the aforementioned. Since the meeting opens at [Time], I recommend that we meet one hour earlier in the Recorderâ€™s office.

I am looking forwards to visiting the Council [with my District Deputy Grand High Priest counterpart] [and] [the grading team] and request that as per the standards of our Most Illustrious Grand Master, Companion Don Paul Payton, no ritual books be used by Companions other than the Chaplain when opening or closing the Council. Most Illustrious Companion Payton strongly encourages ritualistic excellence and warmly welcomes you to participate in the Grand Council Grading Competition.

I will witness the opening of the Council, and then, shortly after, I will retire from the Council room for the official reception, as described in the 2016 edition of the \textit{Texas Council Monitor}, which is also available on the Grand Council's website.

Thank you in advance for your time, effort, and dedication to Cryptic Masonry. Please do not hesitate to contact me in advance with any questions you may have for me.
