Dear Companion [Lastname]:

This year the District Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Council of Texas will be required to make two (2) official visits to each Council in his district during his term of office.  The first official visit should be made prior to March 31st.  The second visit will be made right after 2020 Installation of new Officers for the 2020-2021 year and will be completed before October 31st.

With your consent, I would like to make my first official visit to your Council on Saturday, February 1, 2020. Please advise me if this date is acceptable.  If it is not, please give me two alternative dates on which I can make the official visit.

During the official visit, I would like to meet with the Thrice Illustrious Master, Treasurer, and Secretary at least one hour prior to the meeting time.  The other Officers may attend this meeting if they desire. 

I will witness the opening of the Council, then after the Pledge to the flags, I will retire from the Lodge room and be received.  I will address the Council at the end of your business session and then the Council will be closed.

This year, each Council will also be graded on the Opening and Closing ceremonies. This may happen on the Official Visit or at another meeting set up with the District Graders. I have enclosed the rules for your review. The Council with the highest average score in your region at the end of the year will receive \$500 and presented at the Awards Banquet in December 2020.

I look forward to being with you on this occasion.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
