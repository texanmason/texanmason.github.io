<center><h3>DEATH OF SIR EDWARD W. TAYLOR.</h3></center>

<p>The following general order was issued by the Grand Commander:</p>

<p align="right">Grand Commandery, Knights Templar of Texas,<br>
Office of Grand Commander,<br>
Houston, Texas, November 8, 1886.</p>

<p>To the Grand and Past Grand Officers of the Grand Commandery of Texas,<br>
Officers and Members of all Subordinate Commanderies of this Jurisdiction,<br>
Sir Knights:</p>

<p>It becomes my painful duty to announce that death has invaded our Asylum, and taken our beloved Frater, Past Grand Commander Edward W. Taylor. His labors are ended, and he is at rest forever.</p>

<p>He was a warm-hearted friend, a devoted father and husband, a useful citizen, a zealous Mason and a true and courteous Knight. While we lament his loss, and sympathize with his family, we can console ourselves with the reflection that our loss is his eternal gain. His attendance and devotion to the sick, during yellow fever epidemics alone, are sufficient to cause him to be remembered in the hearts of many.</p>

<p>Sir Edward W. Taylor, Past Grand Commander of the Grand Commandery of Texas, died in the city of Houston, November 5, 1886, at his residence, in the seventy-third year of his age. He was created a Knight Templar in Ruthven Commandery, No. 2, April II, 1849, and was elected Grand Commander in 1857. He was Past Grand Master of Masons, and Past Grand High Priest of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter, and Grand High Priest of the Order of High Priesthood. He had filled many positions in civic life, all of which he discharged faithfully.</p>

<p>It is therefore ordered, as a token of respect to his memory, that the foregoing be read at the head of the lines, at the stated conclave after its reception, and that the usual emblems of mourning be displayed in each Commandery of this grand jurisdiction, until the next annual conclave of the Grand Commandery.</p>

<p>Given under my hand and seal of the Grand Commandery, November 8, A. D. 1886, A. O. 768.</p>
