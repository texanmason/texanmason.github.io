<p>George M. Patrick, M.D., was made a Mason in Benevolent Lodge No. 58 in Kentucky and was initiated, passed and raised in 1827. Other Masonic Lodge affiliations include Temple Lodge No. 4 in Houston, Texas. In 1837, according to biographical information, Dr. Patrick may have served as Worshipful Master of Temple Lodge No. 4 in Houston, Texas, but no Lodge records can substantiate this. In 1842, Dr. Patrick was also a charter member of Orphan's Friend Lodge No. 17 located in Anderson, Texas, and served as its Worshipful Master in 1844, 1846, 1847, 1849, 1850, 1852 and 1853.</p>

<p>Dr. Patrick is the only Texas Mason to have been elected to two full terms as the Grand Master of Masons in Texas, serving first in 1849 and again in 1850. He served as the seventh and last Most Excellent Grand High Priest of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the Republic of Texas (prior to statehood) in 1848-1849 and again as the Most Excellent High Priest of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Texas (following statehood) in 1852-1853. He is the only Freemason in Texas history to have served twice as Grand Master of Masons and twice as the Most Excellent Grand High Priest. Dr. Patrick was the Charter High Priest for Jerusalem Chapter No. 7 under the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the Republic of Texas in 1846, and would later be the Charter High Priest for Jerusalem Chapter No. 3 in 1851, 1853, 1859 and 1860, under the current Grand Jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In 1849, Dr. Patrick served as the Most Excellent Grand High Priest of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the Republic of Texas at the same time he was serving as the Most Worshipful Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Texas Ancient and Free York Masons. In 1850, Dr. Patrick again served as the Most Worshipful Grand Master of of the Grand Lodge of Texas Ancient and Free York Masons. Records also show that in 1850 Dr. Patrick installed Sam Houston as the Master of the Third Veil for San Jacinto Chapter in Huntsville, Texas.</p>

<p>During his 1849-1850 term as Grand High Priest and Grand Master, Dr. Patrick presided as President over the convention that in an agreement with the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons healed and closed the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the Republic of Texas and formed the current Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Texas.</p>

<p>In June of 1856, Dr. Patrick was present at the formation of the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters of Texas in Huntsville, Texas, and served as the Most Puissant Grand Master in 1859. While serving as the Deputy Grand Master and as the Grand Master <i>pro-tem</i>, he issued the Charter for Jerusalem Council No. 7 in Anderson, Texas, from himself to himself as the Charter Thrice Illustrious Master. Additionally, in 1859 Dr. Patrick served as the Right Eminent Grand Commander of the Grand Commandery Knights Templar of Texas, which made him the first Texas Mason to serve as the Presiding Officer of all four of the Grand Bodies that compose the York Rite of Freemasonry.</p>
