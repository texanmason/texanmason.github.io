\section{Exercise A}
Find a quiet space in your home. If you can manage an Oratory, or a place which can be
dedicated to meditation, so much the better. It should be furnished simply --â€“ a chair, a small
table, and a candle. You may burn some incense if you like. Make sure there are no pictures of
living things (human, animal or vegetable) to distract you.

Now you can begin to discipline your mind for the Great Journey out of the \textit{Forest of Errors}, as
Saint-Martin described the general manner of living and thinking.

Put on your alb and cordelier, and don your mask. Darken the room, and seat yourself about four
feet from a mirror. Place a single lighted candle between yourself and the mirror. Relax for a
few minutes, then ask yourself the question put to you at your Initiation:

\begin{quote}
    We do not ask who you are, because if you knew, you would have nothing more to learn; but
we do ask you whom do you think you are?
\end{quote}

Do not discuss this exercise until you have practiced it several times.
