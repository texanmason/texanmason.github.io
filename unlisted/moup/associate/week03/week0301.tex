Master of the Shekinah Glory Chapter

We humbly beg you, Almighty and Eternal God, by Your Only Son, Jesus Christ, Our Master and
Lord, to sanctify + with Your celestial blessing this Altar (Oratory) destined for pure and holy uses.
As in the past You received the prayers and respects of Israel, wandering in the Desert, in a
Tabernacle to which You gave Your Servant, Moses, the service and care, I beg you to consider
this humble Altar (or Oratory) arranged for Your Glory and Your Service. May you, O Lord of the
Sky and the Earth, instill the same virtue that You gave in the past to your Saint of Saints, and
may Your celestial blessing spread in this instant and this place on him, so that Your servants who
will meet around this sacred surface be then sanctified by the Celestial Virtue of the divine
mysteries which will be celebrated there, and may they give them protection of their bodies and
souls, and view the eternal life. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master, and through Saint
John, His servant. Amen. +
