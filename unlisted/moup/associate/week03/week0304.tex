\section{Exercise C}

Through the previous exercise we have learned to observe our thoughts and only if this is
sufficiently practiced and fully mastered may we continue with the next step in our mental
training.

This exercise is to suppress certain thoughts that keep intruding persistently in your mind.
You must, for example, be able not to worry any more about your work or profession, once you
come back into your family and private life. Thoughts not pertaining to your family life must be
extinguished, and you must be capable of instantly becoming a different person. And vice versa.
Once at work you must direct all your thoughts to it, and you should not permit them to wander
away to other subjects such as your home or private life.

This should be practiced until it has become a habit. You must create the habit to do everything,
be it professional, private, vocational, with your full consciousness, and in this you should not
make any difference between important or minor occupations.
