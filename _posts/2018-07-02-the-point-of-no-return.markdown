Tomorrow night is my first meeting as the presiding officer in my Chapter and Council. I've been working on the meeting agenda like a madman staring at the wall, looking for hidden messages. There may be such thing as over-preparing, but for now, I'm just gonna roll with it and let myself obsess over it.

I'm going to be proposing some practical stuff, and a bunch of idealistic stuff. It's gonna be great. I really do hope that this is something that the Chapter and Council see as a positive thing. I also have some education lined up for Council, but I don't know if we'll have enough time. I hope we do. 

I'm praying with gratitude for luck, wisdom, and guidance. I guess I'll report back later with results?
