Well, I've gone and purchahsed a tuxedo. It was a "mid-range budget" type of tuxedo on sale (or perhaps "on sale") at Joseph A. Banks, so nothing fancy, but I'm excited nonetheless. Based off of the fitting, it needed minimal tailoring, and seemed quite nice. 

The next step is to buy a tuxedo shirt. I'm pretty sure that I want the traditional wing-tip collar, but I'm not super crazy about the pleated bib. I may opt for a more modern style of shirt. I also have to find my old suspenders, and buy both a cummerbend (or vest!) and a satin bow tie. I have some bow ties, but none that are black satin.

Now I'm almost ready to show up to fancy fraternal dinners!
