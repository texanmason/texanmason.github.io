Well, it seems that things are going okay. This past Tuesday was a long meeting. There were multiple awards to hand out, all the initial business of the first meeting of the year, and so on. We didn't get out until 9 PM, which is really something we need to try and avoid. Life would be a lot easier if we didn't have the Chapter/Council meetings back-to-back.

Some of the proposals I made seemed to be met with a lot of skepticism - but quiet skepticism. I am remaining optimistic. One thing that I'm proud of is that with the exception of one part where I skipped a short section, I have got the ritualistic opening/closing down really well.

I'm excited to see what kind of change I can help affect here, and how I can help my Chapter & Council grow.
