There will come a time when you need to explain what the heck Masonry is. Sometimes, you won’t have very long. It’s best to come up with an "elevator speech" for those occasions. My answer is a little dramatic:

*The world is an awful place, and there’s not much that we can do about that on the macro scale. What we can do, however, is give men the opportunity to change and improve themselves using moral tools and teachings centered around love of God and love of one another in order to better implement the moral values they already had. By doing this, a man not only changes himself, but the world immediately around him - and sometimes reaching even further than that. So, we can’t change the world on a macro scale, but we can change it many, many times on a micro scale.* ***Masonry is an organized effort to save the world through love, one man at a time.***
